# NYSL Soccer site with sign-up form

This is the final version of the first site that I have designed while studying
front-end development at the Ubiqum Coding Academy.

This project helped me learn HTML, CSS and Flex in particular for building the sign-up form.

The development went through several design/layout changes and implemented functionality
allong the way.
